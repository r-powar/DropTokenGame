# 98point6 Drop Token

## Problem Statement
We would like you to develop an application that allows a player to enjoy a game of 9dt, or 98point6 Drop Token, against the computer. 

## Rules of 9dt
Drop Token takes place on a 4x4 grid. A token is dropped along a column (labeled 1-4) and said token goes to the lowest unoccupied row of the board. A player wins when they have 4 tokens next to each other either along a row, in a column, or on a diagonal. If the board is filled, and nobody has won then the game is a draw. Each player takes a turn, starting with player 1, until the game reaches either win or draw. If a player tries to put a token in a column that is already full, that results in an error state, and the player must play again until they play a valid move.
